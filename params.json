{"name":"openAssemblyAB","tagline":"A project keeping tabs on the Legislative Assembly of Alberta","body":"### Welcome to openAssemblyAB\r\nThis project is developed in the goal of keeping tabs on the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. It is inspired by https://openparliament.ca/. We believe that you should be able to access information that affects your everyday life and to follow what your representative, i.e. your MLA, is doing in the Assembly. We hope that through this tool under development, more and more people are engaged in politics for better decision-making of this province.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently, the project is developed by @zhantongz. You are very welcome to contribute to this project! Fork it now!\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nAny new ideas about the project? Open an issue at https://github.com/zhantongz/openAssemblyAB.\r\n\r\nOther inquiries can be directed to @zhantongz at contact@openassemblyab.ca.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
